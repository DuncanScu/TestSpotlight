While this isnt a revolutionary idea, it can still be useful. TestSpotlight will report back on your test results inside of your project, presenting them to you in a
Github comment. The ongoing idea of this project will be to allow you more control over how your results are presented to you....starting with grouping you tests into catagories e.g. Unit Tests, Acceptance Tests, Integration Tests... you get the idea. Stay tuned :rocket:

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:

```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
